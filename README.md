# **Sifter the Crypto App**

Welcome to _Sifter-the-Crypto-App!_

## **Sifter Description**

_A tool to sift out the cryptocurrency you want to keep track of out of the digital heap._

Our team developed this App as a solution to the time consuming tracking of portfolio totals across multiple exchanges and wallets. We got tired of the tedium of signing in to each app for different exchanges to get those portfolio totals, jotting them down, then signing in to each wallet and repeating the process. Seemed like such a waste of time, however frequently one checks up on their totals. So, we decided to create a single place, not linked to private information or actual exchanges, where a person can safely, securely, check up on their portfolio, all in one place. Our project stands out because what we saw out there was linking official exchanges together and this one lets users do the same thing anonymously, without needing to verify identity and share sensitive information.

After Registration and Login, on the Coin List page, the user can browse all the cryptocurrencies that exist. All data is coming from the coingecko api. As the user peruses the list and all the up-to-date information that is displayed for each coin, the user can choose to add a coin to their curated list, or sift that coin out into their own 'pile'. The user can add as many coins as they'd like. Then, after the user has compiled their list to their satisfaction, navigating to the Curated List page the user will see their saved coins populating in the browser without the coins they aren't interested in. Those coins have effectively been sifted out! Thats not the only difference either. On the Curated List Page, the user can remove/delete a coin they are tracking if they don't want to track it anymore. Also, the user will find an input fields under the header of 'Coin Amount'. In here, the user can save the amount they would like to associate with the corresponding coin. Then, once the amounts are saved to the respective coins, a 'Coin Total' column will display the value 'held' in the app by simply multiplying the amount by the coins current price, so all the data is dynamic! And then finally, the whole point of Sifter, the 'Portfolio Total' will be displayed clearly, front and center. No more signing in and out of exchanges, jotted down numbers, doing math (if you don't wnant to)! Now its as simple of as opening Sifter the Crypo App, and Boom! you have all your coins data in one place.

Features we would like to implement moving forward:

- Customizable Alerts
- Line Graph to visually represent Portfolio Total over time
- Pie Chart to show percentages of sifted "holdings"
- Ability to add any crypto that you could possible want to track, or own. The current version of Sifter is limited to top 100 coins (by market cap).
- Implement a way to donate to the developers
- Include links to articles and videos we think are relevant in the Quest to Decentralize
- Find a way to create community
- and more!
